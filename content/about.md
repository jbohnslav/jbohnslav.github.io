I’m a machine learning engineer at [Zoox](https://www.zoox.com), training and shipping foundation models for robotic perception.

Previously, I worked at [Cobot](http://www.co.bot) as the first perception hire and second SWE. I did zero-to-one prototyping, evaluated sensor suites, designed the perception system, and implemented  initial prototypes.

Prior to that, I was a research scientist at Perceptive Automata, training models to help AVs understand human behavior. 

In my academic life, I did my PhD in Neuroscience at Harvard, building novel computer vision pipelines for analyzing animal behavior in Chris Harvey’s lab.
