`cd jims_blog && git init`

Thanks for checking out my blog! I decided to be like every other PhD student and start one. I'm a sixth year PhD candidate in the [Harvey Lab](http://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School. My main PhD work is on applying computer vision techniques to better understand (mouse) behavior.

I'm on a temporary hiatus working as an intern on the research team at [Perceptive Automata](https://www.perceptiveautomata.com/), applying my knowledge of computer vision to autonomous vehicles.

If you're into daily digests of arxiv's computer vision papers, you can follow me [on twitter here](https://twitter.com/jbohnslav).
