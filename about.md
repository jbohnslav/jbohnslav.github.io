I'm a machine learning engineer at [Zoox](https://www.zoox.com/), training and shipping foundation models for 
robot perception.

Previously, I was a research scientist at [Perceptive Automata](https://www.perceptiveautomata.com/), helping autonomous vehicles intuitively understand human behavior.

Before that, I did my PhD in Neuroscience at Harvard, building novel computer vision pipelines for analyzing animal behavior in [Chris Harvey's lab](http://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu/).
